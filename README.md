# ID5130-PSC

Codes written for the institute course ID5130: Parallel Scientific Computing

## Tutorial 1
Basic C++ practice. Adapted functions provided by the professor for matrix operations. Generated a plot with Python.

## Tutorial 2
Numerical integration with Trapezoidal and Simpson's Rule. Used OpenMP to parallelize the calculations. Used manual work-splitting and parallel for.

## Tutorial 3
Experimentation with *reduction* clause in OpenMP with subtraction and division. Implemented *Odd-Even Transposition Sort* with parallelized inner loops. Tested the behaviour of *private*, *firstprivate* and *threadprivate* variable clauses.

## Tutorial 4
Starting Numerical Methods with OpenMP. Addition, multiplication and implicit & explicit finite differences.

## Tutorial 5
Implemented Iterative Jacobi Method for solving system of linear equations.

## Tutorial 6
Installed OpenMPI. Run a sample Hello World program for MPI provided by the professor for testing.

## Assignment 1
Completely covered numerical methods for OpenMP.

Wrote a serial LU decomposition program, which is used to find solution to a system of linear equation, generated using implicit finite difference scheme (Pade scheme). Implemented a parallel program for Recursive-Doubling algorithm for the same.

Implemented serial Gauss-Seidel algorithm for finding solution to the Poisson equation. Parallelized it using two methods, diagonal approach and red-black coloring approach. Compared performance with different grid sizes and number of threads.
