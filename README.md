# ID5130-PSC

Codes written for the institute course ID5130: Parallel Scientific Computing

## Tutorial 1
Basic C++ practice. Adapted functions provided by the professor for matrix operations. Generated a plot with Python.

## Tutorial 2
Numerical integration with Trapezoidal and Simpson's Rule. Used OpenMP to parallelize the calculations. Used manual work-splitting and parallel for.

## Tutorial 3
Experimentation with *reduction* clause in OpenMP with subtraction and division. Implemented *Odd-Even Transposition Sort* with parallelized inner loops. Tested the behaviour of *private*, *firstprivate* and *threadprivate* variable clauses.

## Tutorial 4
Starting Numerical Methods with OpenMP. Addition, multiplication and implicit & explicit finite differences.
