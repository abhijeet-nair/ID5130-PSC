Add all the problems faced till now, how it was solved (if it was) and what to do to avoid it (if possible):

A2 - Q2_MPI_J.cpp
1) Was defining phik1 matrix with dynamically. Because of that, MPI_Type_vector was failing, since the relative locations of the points is not the same.
   Thus, if you need to use the relative location property for some purpose, do not define dynamically.
